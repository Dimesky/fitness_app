# This app will ask the user if they are a man or a woman, how old they are, 
# how much they weigh, and what their favorite exercise is. It will then allow the 
# user to enter foods that they eat, either by calories or recognized foods (and mounts of
# them). The app will then store the user information in a table, and also store the
# foods that they eat in a separate table (if the food is unrecognized the app will store
# it to be remembered later).
#
# The app will also initially ask the user if they are looking to maintain wieght or
# lose weight and their favorite exercises and foods, and provide them with
# instructions for the day for food intake & exercise.
#
# Eventually, the app will be able to give users suggestions about foods that they commonly
# eat that can be cut out of their diet (with reminders based on when they usually eat
# those foods), and give people reminders throughout the day to exercise based on their
# total food intake for the day.
